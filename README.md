# Strong Hold Singularity Wrappers

Wrapper scripts to simplify calls to software running in singularity containers
The related containers live in [this repository](https://github.com/brown-ccv/docker-stacks/tree/master/stronghold) and are pulled to sh-software workstation via singularity pull. 

The workstation contains only limited containners in path /opt/browncis/containers/bcbi

:warning: Scripts must be executable to work as expected in the workstation
